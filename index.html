        <p>When it comes time to escape the every day mundane activities of life, one of the first places 
            I turn to is between the pages of a book. Ever since I was little my mother would read story 
            books to me and it fascinated me the ways you could travel to other worlds without moving a single inch.
            This website is a resource to facts, recommendations, and more for book related things! </p>

            <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li>Reading improves your critical thinking skills, without even knowing it,
                 our brains provide different perspectives and solutions to the characters, situations 
                and problems that arise in a story.</li><br>
                <li>Reading can also enhance your vocabulary and conversation skills. Learning new words and 
                their meanings help with understanding the world around you.</li><br>
                <li>Picking up a book before bed can help reduce stress and improve your sleep. Reading
                helps distract from the problems of the day, even if it is non-fiction/factual. Studies
                show reading is more effective at reducing stress than going for a walk or listening to music. </li><br>
                <li>Visualizing scenes, characters, and details from a story engages the brain’s sensory regions, 
                enhancing memory retention through vivid mental imagery.</li><br>
                <li>Reading different stories and perspectives helps with viewing things in a different way but 
                it also provides a sense of support and belonging—particularly for those who may consider 
                themselves somewhat of a "black sheep". One of the things reading offers is relatability 
                and a reminder that we are not the first or only person to feel a certain way. 
                Whether fiction or nonfiction, stories help us to process our own experiences-
                to feel seen and understood when this may be something missing in our own lives.
